# 2. Operators and Expressions

# Welcome to the next step in Python!
# Let's learn about operators by solving a simple problem.

# Step 1: Understanding Operators
# Python supports different types of operators:
# - Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
# - Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
# - Logical Operators (and, or, not)
# - Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.)
