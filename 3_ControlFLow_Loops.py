# 3. Control Flow (Decision Making & Loops)

# Now that we understand operators, let's move on to control flow.
# Control flow allows us to make decisions and repeat actions in Python.

# -	Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
# -	Loops:
    # 	for loop with range()
    # 	while loop
    # 	Loop control (break, continue, pass)
