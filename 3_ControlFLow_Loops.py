# 3. Control Flow (Decision Making & Loops)

# Now that we understand operators, let's move on to control flow.
# Control flow allows us to make decisions and repeat actions in Python.


#Do Fizzbuzz problem
# “FizzBuzz” if i is divisible by 3 and 5,
# “Fizz” if i is divisible by 3,
# “Buzz” if i is divisible by 5

# -	Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
# -	Loops:
    # 	for loop with range()
    # 	while loop
    # 	Loop control (break, continue, pass)

num = int(input("Enter Num: "))
